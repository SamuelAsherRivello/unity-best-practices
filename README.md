## Design Principles

**Theory**

**S.O.L.I.D. Principles** make software designs more understandable, easier to maintain and easier to extend. As a software engineer, these 5 principles are essential to know! (See <a href="https://itnext.io/solid-principles-explanation-and-examples-715b975dcad4">ITNext.io</a>)

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **S**ingle Responsibility | One reason to change.                                                                       | ✅                   |
| **O**pen/Closed           | Open for extension, closed for modification.                                                | ✅                   |
| **L**iskov Substitution   | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.                                        | ✅                   |
| **I**nterface Segregation | No client should be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.                         | ✅                   |
| **D**ependency Inversion  | High-level modules should not depend on low-level ones; both should depend on abstractions. | ✅                   |

## Design Patterns

### Theory

These patterns provide solutions to common design problems and are a foundational part of software design knowledge. There are 3 types.

- **Behavioral Patterns** - Design patterns to deal with object-object communication. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern">Wikipedia</a>)
- **Creational Patterns** - Design patterns to deal with object creation. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern">Wikipedia</a>)
- **Structural Patterns** - Design patterns to deal with object-object relationships. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pattern">Wikipedia</a>)

## Features

- **Editor Scripting** - Unity lets you extend the editor with your own custom inspectors and Editor Windows and you can define how properties are displayed in the inspector with custom Property Drawers. See <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExtendingTheEditor.html">Unity Docs</a> for more.

## Tooling

- **Unit Testing** - Software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. See <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/testing-editortestsrunner.html">Unity Docs</a> for more.
